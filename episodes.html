                    Former colleague Elliott and his wife Gretchen offer Walter money for treatment. He refuses. The family council tries to understand the reasons, and White explains: it is better to live less, but without spending and suffering, than to prolong the suffering
                    for yourself and loved ones. At that time Jesse tries to synthesize crystals, but doesn't get the quality he wants. Because of this, the guy is in conflict with a potential accomplice. For the sake of his wife, Walter is ready to be
                    treated, but without financial assistance from outside. He'd rather work with Jesse.

                    Relations between Skyler and Walter remain tense: the wife realizes that her husband is hiding something, and the lie offends her. Jesse is left with nothing in all positions: the money is lost, White does not want to share, his parents kicked him out
                    of the house, his friend did not let him spend the night, and so on. The last hope is to get your van back, but even here it is not without problems. Pinkman would like to synthesize meth again, but without a partner, doing this is
                    almost impossible. There's a chance that Walter will change his mind about tying.

                    a job at her old job, which could stir up the past. Hank, along with new colleagues, falls into a trap: they were sent a mined head of an informant. Jane finds out that Jesse gave false data about himself, but is indifferent to this.

                    There was little money left after the release of Badger. Walter, among other things, is worried about the results of the examination, which will be ready in a few days. White deceives his wife by talking about a trip to his mother. Instead, he, in the
                    company of Jesse, goes to the desert to synthesize meth. In the process, a number of difficulties arise, and the characters repeatedly quarrel. They barely make it back by the deadline. Doctors report a shrinking tumor. Walter takes
                    the news with mixed feelings.

                <p>Gus diligently selects the keys to White. Among other things, he offers the chemist qualitatively new working conditions - a laboratory arranged according to the highest class. Walter resigned himself: his marriage to Skyler could not
                    be saved. He accepts Gus' proposal, signs the divorce papers, and leaves the house with a bag full of money. Hank had previously figured out that the meth maker was moving around in a van. Investigating all the similar cars and other
                    clues, he finds a photo of Jesse in the apartment of Kombo, who was killed earlier.

                    while one of the brothers managed to severely cripple the car, and the second - to shoot. Earlier, White had offered Jesse a collaboration. The guy initially refused, but changed his mind. Skyler wants to understand just how deep Walter
                    is in the illegal business.

                <p>The stress of the past few weeks has taken a toll on Walter. He practically does not sleep, and the fly that has flown into the laboratory does not give rest. Hunting for her almost cost him his health. Jesse joins the process as White
                    is preventing the new batch from being handled for fear of contamination of the samples. Walter had previously noted that shipments were always missing 200 grams of meth. To calm down his partner, Jesse knocks him out with sleeping
                    pills and does the production himself.

                <p>A new danger comes from Skyler's old job. The audit of Ted's company has begun, which means that the former accountant may be on the pencil of the tax and other interested services. Listening to conversations and surveillance are not excluded.
                    Gus wisely assessed his chances against the cartel, so he ceded some of his property to them, including the meth formula. New realities are not to Walter's liking. He was also angry with Jesse, because the guy could have stopped all
                    this if he had not backed out of the agreement and poisoned Gus.

                <p>The meeting with the cartel will take place in Mexico on their territory. Jesse, accompanied by Gus and Mike, has to make a meth presentation. But Fring has bigger plans. He poisons Eladio and his people. Since Gus also had to drink alcohol
                    with poison, he also feels bad. And in a shootout with security, Mike was injured. At this time, Skyler, with the participation of Sol, wrote out a fictitious inheritance for Ted so that he would pay off the tax and not draw attention
                    to the Whites. Except Ted isn't going to do that.

                <p>The past does not bring down the heroes. Hank turns his attention to the cameras in the destroyed laboratory. He finds a laptop where all the notes are probably saved. The equipment is placed in the storage of material evidence. Mike,
                    Walter and Jesse team up to destroy the data on a laptop through a wall using strong magnets. They succeeded, but when analyzing the evidence, law enforcement officers found a new clue. Ted is in an unenviable position, while he promises
                    Skyler that he will tell no one, as he fears for the family.

                    true, then angering such a person is not a good idea.

                <p>Detained earlier, Jesse is not going to testify against Walter. White makes an unexpected move: he writes down a confession, but in them he calls the founder of the drug empire Hank, exposing himself as a forced laborer. There is also
                    a mention of the money spent on the rehabilitation of the brother-in-law. Jesse, on the advice of Walter, is about to leave, but a combination of circumstances makes it clear that the former partner is behind Brock's poisoning. He
                    flies off the coils and thinks only of revenge.

                <p>Todd's uncle, Jack, is pleased that the quality of his nephew's meth has improved significantly. It’s just that he doesn’t succeed in the blue color, and this, whatever one may say, is already a brand. The gang agrees to help kill Jesse
                    if White teaches Todd his formula. Hank, his partner and Pinkman lure Walter out into the desert to the place where the money is buried. Jack also drives up there with the fighters, when the chemist was already in handcuffs. A shootout
                    begins, where the law enforcement officers are clearly outnumbered.
