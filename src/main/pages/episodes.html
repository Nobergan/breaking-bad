                    Former colleague Elliott and his wife Gretchen offer Walter money for treatment. He refuses. The family council tries to understand the reasons, and White explains: it is better to live less, but without spending and suffering, than to prolong the suffering
                    for yourself and loved ones. At that time Jesse tries to synthesize crystals, but doesn't get the quality he wants. Because of this, the guy is in conflict with a potential accomplice. For the sake of his wife, Walter is ready to be
                    treated, but without financial assistance from outside. He'd rather work with Jesse.

                <p>
                    Relations between Skyler and Walter remain tense: the wife realizes that her husband is hiding something, and the lie offends her. Jesse is left with nothing in all positions: the money is lost, White does not want to share, his parents kicked him out
                    of the house, his friend did not let him spend the night, and so on. The last hope is to get your van back, but even here it is not without problems. Pinkman would like to synthesize meth again, but without a partner, doing this is
                    almost impossible. There's a chance that Walter will change his mind about tying.

                    There was little money left after the release of Badger. Walter, among other things, is worried about the results of the examination, which will be ready in a few days. White deceives his wife by talking about a trip to his mother. Instead, he, in the
                    company of Jesse, goes to the desert to synthesize meth. In the process, a number of difficulties arise, and the characters repeatedly quarrel. They barely make it back by the deadline. Doctors report a shrinking tumor. Walter takes
                    the news with mixed feelings.

                <p>Skyler files for divorce and promises Walter not to tell anyone about the drugs if he signs the papers. White had already moved out of the house, but before talking with his wife, he considered the separation temporary. Now he wants to
                    start a business, which he personally informs Gus about. Walter picks up Jesse from the clinic. The guy is depressed, although he claims that he has quit. At this time, somewhere on the border with Mexico, two silent twin brothers
                    kill several illegal immigrants and the driver with whom they traveled, and then burn the car.

                <p>Jesse buys a house from his parents through Saul. He's more than doubled the price by mentioning the drug lab. Saul tasks Mike with monitoring White's home and loved ones, while attempting to cheer up a client who has lost heart over a

                    unsuspecting White's life.

                    clues, he finds a photo of Jesse in the apartment of Kombo, who was killed earlier.

                <p>Jesse is going to continue to work alone, so we need to restore the old outlets. Walter, as promised by Gus, gets a new laboratory and a very competent partner, also a chemist. White talks to his wife, whom he guarantees all kinds of material
                    support for her and the children. Hank nearly arrests Jesse and Walter locked in the van, but they are rescued by Saul. Gus, meanwhile, also takes the trouble away from White. He meets with the twins and proposes to them Tuco's immediate
                    killer, Hank.

                    while one of the brothers managed to severely cripple the car, and the second - to shoot. Earlier, White had offered Jesse a collaboration. The guy initially refused, but changed his mind. Skyler wants to understand just how deep Walter
                    is in the illegal business.

                    switched to Hank. They have questions for Gus, but he is in no hurry to talk about his role. In addition, he eliminates the surviving brother right in the ward. So the DEA and the cartel are deprived of information at once. Unfortunately
                    for Gus, the problems don't end there...

                    pills and does the production himself.

                <p>Jesse plans revenge. Gus sees this as a threat to the entire business. Mike shares his concerns. Walter has no intention of getting rid of his partner. Gus seeks a compromise: Jesse and those who ordered Combo's murder make a forced peace.
                    The death of Thomas makes adjustments to the contract. Jesse goes to meet the offenders. White senses trouble and arrives there on time. He saves Pinkman's life by hitting the bandits with cars. One died from the collision, and the
                    second Walter had to finish off with a shot at point-blank range.

                <p>A new danger comes from Skyler's old job. The audit of Ted's company has begun, which means that the former accountant may be on the pencil of the tax and other interested services. Listening to conversations and surveillance are not excluded.
                    Gus wisely assessed his chances against the cartel, so he ceded some of his property to them, including the meth formula. New realities are not to Walter's liking. He was also angry with Jesse, because the guy could have stopped all
                    this if he had not backed out of the agreement and poisoned Gus.

                <p>The meeting with the cartel will take place in Mexico on their territory. Jesse, accompanied by Gus and Mike, has to make a meth presentation. But Fring has bigger plans. He poisons Eladio and his people. Since Gus also had to drink alcohol
                    with poison, he also feels bad. And in a shootout with security, Mike was injured. At this time, Skyler, with the participation of Sol, wrote out a fictitious inheritance for Ted so that he would pay off the tax and not draw attention
                    to the Whites. Except Ted isn't going to do that.

                <p>Skyler is under stress, including her husband's return home. Walter and Jesse are now setting up makeshift labs. Houses that are covered with awnings during insect control are ideal for them. Mike went around all of Gus's arrested men
                    and offered them a share of the income in exchange for silence. This causes a contradiction in the team: Walter does not want to pay other people's debts. Jesse has melted away from Andrey and doesn't support White over money and the
                    fairness of the cash distribution.

                    by exterminator Todd. He without hesitation shoots the only witness - a teenager on a motorcycle.

                <p>What happened in the desert made me think about the limit. Mike is constantly being watched, so it's dangerous to keep working. He and Jesse want to get out of the business and sell their shares of methylamine. Walter takes the idea with

                    tanker while the partner was under interrogation.

                <p>Walter's business is growing into an empire, just like he wanted. All the witnesses in the Hus case have been killed, and new distribution channels have been found, including in Europe. Jesse gets his cut, even though he didn't ask for
                    it. Skyler doesn't stop trying to stop her husband. She even clearly demonstrates to him that the family has more than enough money. White agrees with the arguments and is going to quit cooking meth. A book found in the house of relatives
                    opens Hank's eyes: Walter is the mysterious Heisenberg.

                <p>After checking some facts, Hank is convinced that he was right about Walter. Jesse is in a bad state: he does not want to take the money and no longer trusts the mentor. White is undergoing another course of treatment for cancer. Between
                    him and Hank there is a frank conversation. Walter is reminded of two things. Firstly, in six months, even if the investigation continues, there will be no one to jail. Secondly, if everything Hank thinks about his brother-in-law is
                    true, then angering such a person is not a good idea.

                    flies off the coils and thinks only of revenge.

                <p>Todd wants to grow the business. He climbs into Skyper's house with his henchmen and makes it clear: she will not be harmed if Lydia's name is not mentioned during interrogations. Later, Todd kills Jesse's ex-lover in front of him. So

                    common company, makes him break away.
