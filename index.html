    <h3 class="third__all-reasons-title">10 Reasons to Watch "Breaking Bad" Series Online</h3>
    <p class="third__text">Everyone will agree that we live in the era of television and the Internet. We are obsessed with new series and sitcoms, and starting
      watch something new, we are in a hurry to write about our impressions on the net and look for related information,
      like pictures or music. At the same time, it is important for many of us to start watching the right series at the right time,
      to be able to join the discussion of what you have watched with your friends. But sometimes, in the midst of many
      mediocre and just average serials meet real gems. Such series not only encourage
      exchange opinions with friends. They make you think. You imagine yourself in the place of the main character and ask
      questions of morality of actions of this or that character.
      <br><br>
      And the "Breaking Bad" series is just such a gem. This show is considered by critics to be one of the
      the best TV series of all time, and fans, of course, agree with this one hundred percent. Everything in "Breaking Bad" is impeccable:
      actors, plot, cinematography and so on. Everyone will enjoy watching this series. But
      there are people who avoid "Breaking Bad" because it's too mainstream for them. But we believe
      that everyone should watch this series, regardless of their prejudices and inclinations.
      <br><br>
      We offer you to get acquainted with ten reasons why you should watch "Breaking Bad" online series right now:
    </p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">10. Subtext</h4>
    <p class="third__text">Subtext is at the heart of any form of art, be it a piece of music, a film or a series. Every scene in "Breaking Bad" means so much more than it really is. If you pay close attention to what is happening on the screen while watching, you will notice that as the characters develop, the subtext becomes more and more distinct. We see the development of the plot, but at the same time, we also notice an additional storyline with subtext that runs almost parallel to the main story. And it gives us additional information, albeit not directly.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">9. Scenario</h4>
    <p class="third__text">It doesn't matter how good the rest of the series is, like the actors or the director. If the script is the weak link, then nothing worthwhile will come of the series. And "Breaking Bad" is one of the most powerful scripts in the history of television. The quality and intensity of the dialogue is so high that you want to watch "Breaking Bad" again and again. And given that all this is filmed and presented with the grace of true masters, it is impossible to tear oneself away from what is happening on the screen.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">8. Idea</h4>
    <p class="third__text">The idea of ​​the "Breaking Bad" series looks so realistic that it captures the viewer from the very first minutes of the very first episode. Walter White, an ordinary chemistry teacher who squanders all his talent in the school walls, finds out that he has cancer. To pay for the treatment, he decides to use his brilliant knowledge of chemistry. In general, everything is very vital, and therefore it is easy to empathize with the hero. We are shown the problems of a middle-class man who has a family, an inoperable tumor and not enough money for all expenses. Walter indulges in all serious and begins to cook drugs, using the knowledge of chemistry. This idea has never been taken up before, and producer Vince Gilligan has done a brilliant job of bringing us one of the best TV shows of our time.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">7. Cruelty</h4>
    <p class="third__text">Violence may be one of the reasons why someone does not want to watch "Breaking Bad" online, but once you start watching, you will realize that this series is different from other representatives of the industry. The cruelty of "Breaking Bad" can be called, if you like, artistic. The way death is shown here makes you appreciate it more. In this series there is no tin for the sake of tin. Death is shown only when it is really needed. The death of characters in the series is always shown at the right moment.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">6. Black humor</h4>
    <p class="third__text">"Breaking Bad" is not as dark as many people think. It also has humor. But most of all, black humor is appreciated here, of course. Walter White can be both a goofy family man and a terrifying Heisenberg. Walter White's transformation into Heisenberg is fairly subtle, and what follows is often accompanied by a dose of humor. If you like sharp and creative jokes, then "Breaking Bad" is definitely worth a watch.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">5. Theme</h4>
    <p class="third__text">From the very beginning, "Breaking Bad" has been based on the theme of the inherent choice between good and bad, between good and evil, and between morality and immorality. Both main characters, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, are essentially pure and innocent, and they even start brewing meth for an innocent reason. But when at the same time you are drawn into something bad or wrong, before you blink an eye, you will inevitably fall into the world of bad guys. The "Breaking Bad" series portrays this theme very well.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">4. Supporting actors</h4>
    <p class="third__text">It would be unfair to praise only the main characters of "Breaking Bad". Especially when the supporting actors are so badass. For example: the indecisive but still strong Skyler White; Hank Schrader, DEA chief and Walt's brother-in-law; or Saul Goodman, Walt and Jesse's knowledgeable lawyer who solves all their problems. And even the actors we only see for a moment on the show play their roles so skillfully that it's impossible to completely hate even the creepiest and most violent villains like Gustavo Fring. Not surprisingly, supporting actors also won awards for their top-notch work. And Saul Goodman even got his own spin-off.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">3. Camera work</h4>
    <p class="third__text">There is one thing that truly sets "Breaking Bad" apart from its contemporaries. This is an absolutely incredible work of the operator. As a rule, filming series is limited by budget and time, so it is rare to see first-class camera work on television. But "Breaking Bad" breaks all the rules and gives out such amazing angles that you want to endlessly admire every frame. The time lapse burst, the camera angles and perspectives, and the way important scenes are filmed will really amaze you. And if you understand and understand camera art and photography, then you should definitely watch "Breaking Bad" online.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">2. Aaron Paul</h4>
    <p class="third__text">Women will definitely want to watch "Breaking Bad" online because of the sexy guy Aaron Paul. But this actor stands out not only for his attractive appearance. Aaron's acting is truly breathtaking, he does his job masterfully. For the role of Jesse Pinkman, he even received an Emmy Award. It's all the more surprising that Vince Gilligan, the creator of "Breaking Bad", originally planned to kill off this character in the very first season, but changed his mind because the audience really liked him. After watching "Breaking Bad", you can say that Aaron Paul was born to play the role of Jesse Pinkman. His acting, expressions and dialogue will make you fall in love with this character.</p>

    <h4 class="third__reason-title">1. Bryan Cranston</h4>
    <p class="third__text">And finally, one of the main reasons to watch "Breaking Bad" is the main actor of the series. The actor who made Walter White a truly iconic character. We could see the talent of Bryan Cranston before, in the TV series Malcolm in the Middle, for example, but here he reveals his skills to the fullest. Such a popular and cult status "Breaking Bad" deserved largely due to the excellent performance of Brian. In especially tense scenes, he can notably scare the viewer, in others, where he behaves stupidly and stupidly, he can cause a sincere smile. Bryan Cranston has won Best Actor awards for three years in a row and he definitely deserves it. If another actor had been cast as Walter White, "Breaking Bad" might not have become as popular. But Bryan Cranston does his job perfectly. And that's at least why you should forget about all the prejudices and start watching an online series called "Breaking Bad".</p>
